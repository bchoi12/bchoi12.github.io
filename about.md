title: Where did the Past Go?
---

Hey! I'm not sure how you stumbled upon this page, but I hope you enjoy this blog. 

I'm currently in my third year at college. And although I've been in academia for over two years now, it still feels like it was only yesterday when I was a na&iuml;ve freshman, getting hopelessly lost around campus, experiencing all sorts of new things and being really excited about the future. Two years later I still occassionally get lost and I still experience cool new things, but I'm no longer as ambitious about the future. Part of me never wants to graduate--I never want to have to leave academia where all I do is learn, where everyday is something new and where self-improvement is my only worry in life.

This blog's purpose is to capture some glimpses of the college life. Hopefully it'll be exciting.
